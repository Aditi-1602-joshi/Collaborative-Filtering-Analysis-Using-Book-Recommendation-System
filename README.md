# Collaborative-Filtering-Analysis-Using-Book-Recommendation-System
This Repository contains, Front end as well as Backend for the Book Recommendation System I designed, using Collaborative Filtering Techniques.

The Backend, or the Machine Learning part of this project is done by using three collaborative filtering techniques, namely Cosine similarity, Pearson Correlation and lastly k-NN. This was done to analyze each technique's performance for the recommendation system. 

After doing so, a Genre-based recommendation is also provided in this project. Also, to assist the user's ease and understanding of each book, a summary and genre was also included, in th eoriginal dataset.

Concluding this, Flask was used to design a front-end for thsi , using html and CSS for the web page.
